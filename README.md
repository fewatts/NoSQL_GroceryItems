# Grocery List API

This is a simple Spring Boot application that serves as an API for managing a grocery list. It's designed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on grocery items. The application uses MongoDB as the database for storing grocery items.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) installed.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed and running.
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework.
- An API client (e.g., [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)) for testing API endpoints.
